# What does the application do?
* This application is a marketplace platform which focuses on household goods, primarily secondhand. Users will be able to purchase such goods or post items for sale. 
* Users will have access to filters in order to navigate the site to look for items they are interested in, as well as use a search bar to look for specific items.
* A review system will be implemented to gauge the trustworthiness and quality of the items being sold on the market, which will tie into the overall satisfaction rating of whoever is the seller of the item.
* Authentication for account login and the registration of users.
* Allow user to adjust settings on their accounts (i.e. passwords)
* Allow users to adjust the stock/and the items that are being sold and details about the product.

# What is the motivation for the application?
* The motivation for Household Haven stems from the fact that affordable household items can be difficult to get ahold of. New household goods can be very expensive, and throwing away any such unwanted goods is unsustainable. With this in mind, Household Haven is designed with the focus of reselling household items, providing users with lower prices than what they can expect from newer goods.

# Who would use the application?
* Household Haven would ideally be for individuals who are in the market for affordable household items, or for individuals who wish to sell such items that they no longer need, whether for income generation or for decluttering or downsizing purposes.

# Is there a need or want in the market it fulfills?
* Among the many marketplace web applications on the internet, the most competitive ones offer a large variety when it comes to the items they offer for sale. Household Haven provides a platform which specializes in the sale/resale of household items specifically, narrowing down the clutter of product/goods variety, and providing a neat platform in which users can navigate for a curated selection of items they know they are in the market for. Focusing on secondhand and the resale of items also provides a more economical selection for users to choose from, helping users with cost savings. The reuse of household items also promotes environmental sustainability, which is another potential avenue for attracting potential users. 

# What technologies do you plan on using?

The emphasis on second-hand goods promotes environmental sustainability and offers users a more budget-friendly option compared to buying brand-new items.
